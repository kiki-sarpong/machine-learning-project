## Machine Learning Project
Machine Learning Project for fall 2020.  

Project topic is centering Natural Language Processing sentiment analysis.<br>
We study a dataset of amazon fine food reviews and create a machine learning model to predict the sentiment behind the review.<br>
This is similar to the 5 star system but in this case the machine model predicts the star level of the review.<br>
<br>
1 star - Highly Negative<br>
2 star - Somewhat Negative<br>
3 star - Neutral<br>
4 star - Somewhat Positive<br>
5 star - Highly Positive<br>
<br>
